In my version of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life:
(1) A pattern could only be drawn on the grid only if there is enough sapce for the pattern.
For example, if you select Block as you pattern and you want to draw the block on the most top right 
cell, the Block will not appear on th grid since there are only 2 cells left but a Block needs 4 cells.
(2) A pattern could be drawn on the top of others. (Overlapping is allowed)
